* implement more efficient Arma
  * maybe check whether Numba helps?
* Arma integration tests
  * use with a random source
    * check location + scale work
    * check distribution, ensure fix_source_scale works
  * benchmark speed of various `_mode`s
  * show distribution of generated poles / zeros
